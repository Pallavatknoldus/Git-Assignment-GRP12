Topic:- ADD

GIT ADD :- The git add command adds new or changed files in our working directory to the Git staging area. git add is an important command - without it, no git commit would ever do anything. Sometimes, git add can have a reputation for being an unnecessary step in development. But in reality, git add is an important and powerful tool. git add allows us to shape history without changing how you work.





We created 5 different branches for every member with the following command:-
git checkout -b branch-name
  
  
  

We have created documentation for git add and everyone has pushed there own documentation in their respective branches.
